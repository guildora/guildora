# API Contracts

This document summarizes the current HTTP surface owned by the Nuxt apps.

Operational application APIs live under `apps/hub/server/api`.
`apps/web` only exposes one compatibility Nitro route for OAuth redirect recovery.

Auth shorthand used below:

- `public`: no session required
- `session`: any authenticated session, including `temporaer`
- `staff`: `moderator`, `admin`, or `superadmin`
- `admin`: `admin` or `superadmin`
- `superadmin`: `superadmin` only

See also [`permissions-matrix.md`](./permissions-matrix.md).

## App Ownership Summary

- `apps/hub` owns the real Discord OAuth callback, logout, internal resources, member APIs, moderator APIs, admin APIs, and CMS SSO bootstrap.
- `apps/web` owns one compatibility route at `/api/auth/discord` that redirects the request to hub.

## Notes on Current Product Boundaries

- Marketplace pages in the hub app are currently an iframe shell or redirects, not a local feature-complete marketplace product.
- The schema still contains `app_marketplace_submissions`, and app-submission checks still exist in utilities, but there is no active local submissions API in hub.
- Landing is public and intentionally thin; if OAuth requests hit landing by mistake, the web shim forwards them to hub instead of handling auth locally.
