# Guildora

> **Status: Experimental / Active Development**
> Guildora is under active development. APIs, database schema, and features may change without notice. Not recommended for production use yet.

Guildora is a monorepo for a Discord-centered community platform. It combines:

- **`apps/web`** — Nuxt 4 public landing page
- **`apps/hub`** — Nuxt 4 internal hub for members, moderation, admin, auth, and APIs
- **`apps/bot`** — Discord bot for voice tracking, guild sync, and setup helpers
- **`packages/shared`** — Shared TypeScript package with Drizzle schema, DB client, and cross-service types
- **`packages/app-sdk`** — TypeScript SDK types for sideloaded community apps

### App Extension System

Guildora supports community-built apps that extend the hub with custom pages, API routes, bot hooks, and slash commands. Apps are installed via sideloading (GitHub URL or local path) and run sandboxed within the platform. Vue SFC pages support relative imports for components, composables, and utilities. See the [developer docs](https://github.com/guildora/docs/tree/main/for-developers) for details.
